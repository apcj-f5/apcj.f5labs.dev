      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking of moving my Kubernetes lab into the cloud, but with cloud resource usage being scrutinized by the IT department, running them 24x7 the way I&amp;rsquo;m used to is a no-go. I need a setup that meets the following requirements:
 Simple to create and tear down Applications must be pre-deployed when the cluster is up, as close to &amp;ldquo;just the way I left it there last night&amp;rdquo; as possible cost $0 when the setup has been switched off  I eventually settled on the idea of an ephemeral Kubernetes lab environment using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and GitOps practices, which I will cover in this post.</description>

      <description>Intro I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing a lot with terraform lately, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for ways to make my terraform configurations a lot simpler and have less repetition. Like a lot of people, I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself repeating the same code over and over. An example is where I repeat the same resource over and over but with different configuration parameters. It&amp;rsquo;s essentially the same resource. Why should I do this? There has to be a better way.</description>

      <description>I have had basic experience playing with Terraform to instantiate resources in Kubernetes and AWS, but my previous attempts left me with a thought, how do I implement this at work and scale it up to the team?
Terraform creates a local state file which seems like a pain to share around a team. This is when I found out about remote backends. And this is my attempt to learn Terraform S3 backend.</description>
