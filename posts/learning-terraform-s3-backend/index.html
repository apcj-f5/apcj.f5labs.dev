        <p>I have had basic experience playing with Terraform to instantiate resources in Kubernetes and AWS, but my previous attempts left me with a thought, how do I implement this at work and scale it up to the team?</p>
<p>Terraform creates a local state file which seems like a pain to share around a team. This is when I found out about remote backends. And this is my attempt to learn <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/settings/backends/s3.html">Terraform S3 backend</a>.</p>
<h1 id="setup">Setup<a href="#setup" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>Terraform S3 backend stores the state file in an AWS S3 bucket, and if required, uses DynamoDB to manage state locking (highly recommended when working in a team).</p>
<p>So&hellip; to manage infrastructure using Terraform, I first need to deploy the supporting infrastructure üòÖ</p>
<p>üêî and ü•ö problem much?</p>
<p>There are guides online to perform this setup using Terraform, but I&rsquo;ll keep it simple for now and do it manually through AWS console.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create an S3 bucket</li>
<li>Create DynamoDB table</li>
<li>Create a role with policy to interact with S3 and DynamoDB (I called it <code>terraform-backend-role</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>With that, I am now able to use Terraform with the state tracked remotely. Along with state locking, multiple people in the team can access the same state file safely, as long as their IAM users have the correct permission to assume the role to read/write to S3 and DynamoDB.</p>
